# Unsupervised
Code
The code was done using Google Colab Notebooks.
There are two notebooks
1. DATASET A_ unsupervised.ipynb
2. DATASET B_ unsupervised.ipynb

The first notebook contains the Bitcoin Dataset
The second notebook contains the Reddit Dataset.

The code is self contained within these two notebooks and can be run cell by cell in order.
The dataset will be download from pytorch geometric library repository. 
Saved pickle files were located in a google for reuse in the Neural network training and for plotting.
